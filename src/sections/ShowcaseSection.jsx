              <h2>POS Software Solution for Cafes and Hotels</h2>
              <p className="text-white-50 md: text-md">
                I built a comprehensive POS (Point of Sale) software tailored
                specifically for cafes, dhabas, and small-scale restaurants to
                streamline their daily operations. This system was designed to
                be highly intuitive and scalable, covering everything from
                inventory and sales management to table-wise ordering and staff
                coordination. It supports QR-based table scanning for quick
                order placements, real-time kitchen order ticket (KOT) updates,
                and offers an expense management module to help owners track
                operational costs efficiently. Additionally, the platform
                includes role-based access for staff, insightful sales
                analytics, and a smooth customer experience. The project has
                already been deployed in real-world environments, and detailed
                demo videos are available on the YouTube channel for anyone who
                wants to explore its features further.
